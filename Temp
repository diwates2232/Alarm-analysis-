To achieve our objective of Operational Efficiency and establish better control and governance, the GSOC India team has developed an in-house Health-Check automation application: the Device Health Monitoring & Trend Analysis Dashboard. This single-pane view tracks live status and downtime for Cameras, Archivers, Servers, and Controllers across all Western Union sites.”


Manual logs and static reports are slow, error-prone, and entirely reactive. Hidden failures escalate into service interruptions, risking revenue and reputation.”


Here’s the flow we built:
	1.	The system continuously pings every device.
	2.	It captures online/offline status and archives history.
	3.	Status updates populate the dashboard in real time.
	4.	Historical data feeds trend-based maintenance recommendations.”


Open your browser, navigate to the dashboard, and securely log in. Instantly view your Global Summary: total devices, online vs. offline, and regional breakdowns.”


One click isolates any region. Toggle All, Online, or Offline devices. Refine by device type—cameras, controllers, servers—and view performance trends over your chosen period.”


Drill down to city-level detail—Pune, Manila, and more—for in-depth analysis.”


Our dashboard transforms operations with:
	1.	Real-Time Visibility
	2.	Dynamic Filtering
	3.	Actionable Offline Alerts
	4.	Failure Trend Identification
	5.	30-Day Historical Analysis

The result? Faster incident response, reduced downtime, smarter maintenance scheduling, and crystal-clear accountability.”


With planned enhancements—predictive analytics and advanced alerting—this dashboard will grow alongside your needs. Transform device management from reactive to proactive, bolster operational efficiency, and keep your security infrastructure resilient. Request a demo today.”
